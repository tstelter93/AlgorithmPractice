	 * The Divide and Conquer appraoch
	 * 
	 * Divide  - the problem into a number of SUBPROBLEMS that are smaller instances of the same problem.
	 * 
	 * Conquer - the SUBPROBLEMS by solving them recursively.  If the subproblem sizes are small enough, 
	 *           however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.
	 *           
	 * Combine - the SOLUTIONS to the SUBPROBLEMS int the solution for the original problem.
